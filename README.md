Welcome to the Tableau Return Analysis project repository! This project explores and visualizes return data to provide valuable insights for decision-makers and stakeholders. By leveraging the power of Tableau, we've transformed raw data into meaningful visualizations that uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities in returns.
# Project Overview
## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze returns in the context of our business, ultimately helping us reduce returns, optimize processes, and enhance customer satisfaction.
## Tableau Dashboard
Created a dynamic Tableau dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the return analysis, including:
- **Return Trends**: Visualizes the return patterns over time, enabling us to spot seasonal or periodic variations.
- **Product Insights**: Examines return rates for different products, helping us identify problematic items.
- **Reasons for Returns**: Breaks down return reasons, highlighting areas for improvement in our processes.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Shows return distribution by region, helping us focus on areas with higher return rates.
